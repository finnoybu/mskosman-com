## Warm-up (3 minutes)

Begin with a brief discussion to activate prior knowledge:
- Ask students what they already know about physical education
- Share one interesting fact or question related to today's topic
- Preview the lesson objective

## Direct Instruction (5 minutes)

Introduce the core concept for this lesson:

**Key Concept**: Foundational principles of Physical Education at the 12th Grade level.

- Explain the main idea clearly and concisely
- Use grade-appropriate language and examples
- Connect to real-world applications
- Model the thinking process or procedure

## Guided Practice (4 minutes)

Work through examples together:

1. Present a sample problem or scenario
2. Think aloud while solving or analyzing
3. Invite student participation and questions
4. Check for understanding with quick verbal checks

**Example Activity**: A hands-on task that reinforces the concept taught in direct instruction.

## Independent Practice / Quick Check (3 minutes)

Students complete a brief assessment:

- 2-3 quick problems or questions
- Can be verbal, written, or digital
- Provides immediate feedback on understanding
- Identifies students who may need additional support

**Assessment Questions**:
1. What is the main concept we learned today?
2. Apply the concept to solve a simple problem
3. Explain your thinking

## Differentiation

**For Students Needing Support**:
- Provide additional visual aids or manipulatives
- Break tasks into smaller steps
- Offer sentence frames or templates
- Use peer partnerships

**For Advanced Students**:
- Extend the complexity of problems
- Encourage them to explain concepts to others
- Provide challenge questions that require deeper thinking
- Connect to more advanced topics

## Extensions

For students who finish early or want to explore further:
- Additional practice problems with increasing difficulty
- Research project related to the topic
- Creative application (art, writing, presentation)
- Connection to other subjects or real-world scenarios

## Notes for Parent/Instructor
